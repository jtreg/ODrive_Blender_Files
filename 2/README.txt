# Summary

This is a 9g micro servo mount for flat surfaces.  For example, I use this with an ultrasonic range sensor attached to the servo on my STEM roaming robot.  The Servo mount is screwed (M2 screws) into a flat plastic plate that serves as the chassis of my robot.


Print instructions:
I've been using PLA, 0.15 rez
Version 4:
-  added for better drop in and more secure fit.  
-  printed right side up and allows for 2 screws to secure the servo in place.
-  supports may be needed.
-  added two extra screw holes in the center under the servo to offer more mounting options.

Version 3:
-  useful for easy insertion and removal.
-  May work better with your slicer.
-  supports not needed.
